# UCI-Adult-Census-Income-
This project focuses on auditing, cleaning, and transforming the UCI Adult Census Income dataset into an analysis-ready format. The goal was to identify socio-economic patterns that influence income levels (&lt;=50K vs >50K) and provide a clean dataset, exploratory analysis, and a reproducible data processing pipeline.
